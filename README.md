### The Problem

##### I was giving the following assignment/challenge by a company a family member of mine belongs to:

* Display the current crew manifest for the NCC Over 9000.
* Display a searchable list of possible new crew members from the following endpoint:
  * http://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=star+trek+deep+space+nine+characters&format=json&pretty=1
* Allow the user to select one or more crew members from the list.
* Allow the user to add the selected people to the current crew manifest.
